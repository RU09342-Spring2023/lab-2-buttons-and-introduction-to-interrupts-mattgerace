What is causing the bias/baseline in the polling example to be higher than the interrupt example.

The baseline in the polling example is higher because it requires more power to constantly check and poll for possible changes.  It is constantly running
in an attempt to view changes.  The interrupt works by causing a spike in power and only using that power when the interrupt is performed.


Even with the LED unplugged, why is there still power increases when you press the button?

The power is increased because it requires the processor to do a calculation and enter either the interrupt block or
it enters the polling block.  This causes a spike in power regardless of if the LED is turned on or not.  In addition, the line that turns PxOUT to high still provides power.
